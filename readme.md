##[karabiner](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/tree/master/karabiner#karabiner-set-up)

The most exciting thing in here is probably [how](https://my.mindnode.com/VvyDG2X6u54FMSC5EExRGzozqyHqUG5gVM45QP9p) I utilise [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/). It has absolutely transformed the way I interact with my computer and there is no going back now. Here is the layout that I currently use for my keyboard.

##[zsh](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/tree/master/zsh#aliases-and-zsh-functions)

I also am using [zsh](http://www.zsh.org) as my shell with [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) configuration. Here is how my prompt looks currently :

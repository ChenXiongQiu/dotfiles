#my configuration files for macOS

##karabiner

Probably the most excited thing in here is my [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) config file as I actually took some time to set it up and it has boosted my productivity a lot. 

All of what and how I use karabiner to work for me can be found [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/tree/master/karabiner).

##neovim

[Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) is a fork of vim that adds onto vim and that is what I use as my editor of choice for pretty much anything I code. Other editors I use are [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for java and xCode for Swift and iOS development.

##hammerspoon

I don't use [hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) as extensively and right now only use it show my current task I am working on briefly in my screen but it does have quite a lot of really nice things especially when it comes to window management.

##zsh

I also am using [zsh](http://www.zsh.org) as my shell with [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) configuration. Here is how my prompt looks currently :

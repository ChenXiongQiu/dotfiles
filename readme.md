<h1 align="center"> Description 📕</h1>


These are the various configuration files I use on macOS. I wrote about how I customise and use my shell in article [here](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/pretty-and-fast-shell-97ea870f2805).

You can also see my top used applications, safari exensions and alfred workflows I use [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os).

The most exciting thing in here is probably how I utilise [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/). It has absolutely transformed the way I interact with my computer and there is no going back now.

I am [still learning vim](https://my.mindnode.com/24sx5yV3S7FLayi5Msvhysx5HZ8aAPzUqJ6rStKi) but the this journey has been very rewarding. Modal editing is pretty amazing. 

My main editor of choice is [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) since it also has very well built [vim mode](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim).

<h1 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/tree/master/hammerspoon">Hammerspoon 🔨</a></h1>

I don't use [hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) as extensively however I am looking into implementing more of its features into my workflow.

<h1 align="center">zsh 🐚</h1>

I also am using [zsh](http://www.zsh.org) as my shell with [antibody](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody) plugin manager. 

Here is how my prompt looks currently :

##my configuration files for OSX 

Probably the most excited thing in there is my [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) config file as I actually took some time to set it up and it has a lot of interesting things like : 

1. mapping my caps lock key to act as esc on single press and as two modifier keys when pressed with something, you have to also change caps lock to F19 with [Seil](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en) first.
2. mapping my right command to a combination for a single press so I can then use it as my [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) prompt
3. changing my right shift key to act as another two modifier keys that I can then map to some interesting app specific hotkeys and it it also serves as my delete key
4. also switched around the locations of my round brackets to a more 'friendly' location for me
5. changed my fn key to also act as a 'super modifier' key that allows me to use another set of hotkeys, for right now I just use it to put my laptop to sleep with fn + s 

These changes I have made have provided me with some really amazing productivity boosts. One thing that is also really amazing and comes as one of the default settings you can choose in Karabiner is system wide vim emulation. That to be honest is really incredible. I have it binded to my left command so I can essentially have vim navigation and all the vim good stuff in whatever application I will be working in.

Speaking of vim, I am actually learning to use it and am planning to do all my development work in here, except of course java which will be handled by [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). I am very new to vim so the config file is very bare, I want to first learn the already powerful default tools that come with the text editor before adding other plugins and things.I am also jumping straight into [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) instead of vim. So my neovim will be pretty bare and not that insightful at least for now. I will try to keep it clean as per the quote "don't put any lines in your vimrc that you don't understand."

I also am using [zsh](http://www.zsh.org) as my shell with [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) configuration. I really like it right now and I quite like the nice themes that it has that you can easily download with no set up necessary. Here is the one I am using now :

Prezto seems really nice and I really like how fast it seems to be although I really disklike how it has all these extra files that come with it that I still don't fully understand. I may try to run zsh without any frameworks and try to get a better understanding of what is done first and what needs what. 

I am planning to also play around with [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/), mostly for trying out some window management ideas that I have. So will add my init.lua here later hopefully.
